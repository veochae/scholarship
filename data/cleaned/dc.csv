The Cryptops Exchange uses asset tokenization to provide an intuitive, secure and censorship resistant method for trading crypto currency option derivatives directly on blockchain. Cryptops is currently... the only decentralized exchange that uses asset tokenization to issue traditional financial derivatives directly to an on-blockchain order book.

Other decentralized derivatives exchanges require users to install web browser plugins in order to ""connect"" to a hybrid off-chain order book to place orders and make trades. This insecure method causes users to constantly lose millions in various ""hacks"", ""exploits"" and ""vulnerabilities"". These problems are solved using Cryptops where trades happen directly on the verifiable blockchain order book with transactions closing on average in under 5 seconds.

Some unique benefits of the Cryptops project.
• The most censorship resistant cryptocurrency derivatives DEX available.
• The most secure and convenient staking model that does not involve any kind of obscure lending practices or lockups.
• The asset token derivatives are exercisable to tokens that are pegged in value and directly transferable to real world native coins on their blockchains.

### Page Personalization:
• Our team is responsible for research and development of the machine learning algorithms that create the Netflix homepage for all our over members around the world across all the devices. This is primarily focused on deciding which rows of recommendations produced by our many ranking algorithms to show, so that members can easily find something great to watch and enjoy, but also includes work on in general what all our algorithms should optimize for and how to personalize additional aspects of the user experience. There is very little processing done on the output of our algorithms, so the work we do has a large impact on how people use Netflix. This means that we take on the responsibility for understanding and predicting all of the different reasons that someone may want to visit Netflix and help them find what they need. When we do our jobs well, we help people all over the world find a bit more joy.

Experience Personalization:
• Our team works at the intersection of UX design and machine learning. We research and develop algorithms that decide which information about a movie to show to our members. For example, we are responsible for selecting the best artwork and synopsis for each show on a Netflix homepage. We also explain why a member should care about a new movie, TV show, or game. The goal is to help our members make great decisions on the next title to watch. A lot of our work involves contextual bandit algorithms including deploying models, investigating and improving state-of-the art-algorithms, and evaluation metrics. When we do our jobs well, we help people to select the best entertainment on the planet.

Personalization Rankers:
• Our core team works on the core recommendations and personalization algorithms. These algorithms (alongside Page Personalization) are responsible for most of what’s shown on the Netflix homepage (which drives 80% of what members in Netflix play).

Some areas you’ll be working in:- Recommender Systems and Personalization. Almost every aspect of the Netflix experience is personalized, and much of that personalization is driven by our various flavors of recommendation algorithms.
• Causal Inference And Reinforcement Learning. As we’re ever seeking to align our recommendations with what titles members love, it’s important to tease apart the cause-and-effect of what we’re doing. You’ll work with large scale CI and RL algorithms to achieve this.
• Large Scale Machine Learning. Netflix is available in over 190 countries, with over 200+ million members. This gives us a unique dataset to work with, but also unique challenges in how we scale our models. You’ll work on cutting edge techniques to scale your models for use in our production systems.

Search and Recommendations:
- This applied ML team is responsible for improving our member experience by innovating on algorithms for all aspects of Search and other discovery canvases where members express their entertainment needs explicitly. Such mechanisms are a primary way for our members to discover and engage with content on our service. Algorithms innovation in this area, hence is critical, as our content offerings scale and become diverse.
- Our work is a mixture of applied research and engineering to do end-to-end machine learning i.e. from inception of an idea to its productization via online and offline experiments. We work in a highly cross-functional environment, collaborating very closely with PMs, back end and front end engineers, data scientists and engineers, UX Designers, editors, etc.
• Typically we require experience and expertise in Applied ML, Search, Recommendations, Personalization, NLP, KG, HCI, as well as proficiency in software engineering, familiarity with distributed computing and Deep Learning frameworks.

Following are some of our recent publications:- Augmenting Netflix Search with In-Session Adapted Recommendations - RecSys 2022
• Query Facet Mapping and its Applications in Streaming Services: The Netflix Case Study - SIGIR 2022
• Recommendations and Results Organization in Netflix Search, RecSys 2021
• Improving Search Results Ranking Using a Knowledge Graph at KINN-CIMK 2021
• Challenges in Search on Streaming Services: Netflix Case Study SIGIR 2019

Growth and Notifications:
• Our team focuses on personalization of the end-to-end user lifecycle at Netflix.
• For example, we work on a better personalized experience for signup (e.g. personalize the signup flow), optimize the payment experience (increase the success of a transaction going through, detect fraud), and personalize the messaging experience (when and what to send via emails, push notifications and pop-ups).
• As Netflix shifts to commerce and ads, we also started shifting our focus to monetization such as detecting sharing and making better predictions of life-time value.
• Functionally, we go from prototyping all the way to launching experiments and productionization. We often leverage causal inference and context bandits in a lot of our problem formulations.

Next to the images I also have two different HTML representations of... the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.

The Task is the following

1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.

2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch

3. Choose a good framework for training the network

4. Guide me through the setup of a training pipeline for the network in AWS with all necessary steps (I do not have experience here)

6. It should be possible to interrupt the training process and conitune whenever new training data becomes available

7. Give me some estimate how much training data and time we would need to get a good result

What I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.

I have a sample training data available if you are interested.

Areas:
### Page Personalization:
• Our team is responsible for research and development of the machine learning algorithms that create the Netflix homepage for all our over members around the world across all the devices. This is primarily focused on deciding which rows of recommendations produced by our many ranking algorithms to show, so that members can easily find something great to watch and enjoy, but also includes work on in general what all our algorithms should optimize for and how to personalize additional aspects of the user experience. There is very little processing done on the output of our algorithms, so the work we do has a large impact on how people use Netflix. This means that we take on the responsibility for understanding and predicting all of the different reasons that someone may want to visit Netflix and help them find what they need. When we do our jobs well, we help people all over the world find a bit more joy.

Experience Personalization:
• Our team works at the intersection of UX design and machine learning. We research and develop algorithms that decide which information about a movie to show to our members. For example, we are responsible for selecting the best artwork and synopsis for each show on a Netflix homepage. We also explain why a member should care about a new movie, TV show, or game. The goal is to help our members make great decisions on the next title to watch. A lot of our work involves contextual bandit algorithms including deploying models, investigating and improving state-of-the art-algorithms, and evaluation metrics. When we do our jobs well, we help people to select the best entertainment on the planet.

Personalization Rankers:
• Our core team works on the core recommendations and personalization algorithms. These algorithms (alongside Page Personalization) are responsible for most of what’s shown on the Netflix homepage (which drives 80% of what members in Netflix play).

Some areas you’ll be working in:- Recommender Systems and Personalization. Almost every aspect of the Netflix experience is personalized, and much of that personalization is driven by our various flavors of recommendation algorithms.
• Causal Inference And Reinforcement Learning. As we’re ever seeking to align our recommendations with what titles members love, it’s important to tease apart the cause-and-effect of what we’re doing. You’ll work with large scale CI and RL algorithms to achieve this.
• Large Scale Machine Learning. Netflix is available in over 190 countries, with over 200+ million members. This gives us a unique dataset to work with, but also unique challenges in how we scale our models. You’ll work on cutting edge techniques to scale your models for use in our production systems.

Search and Recommendations:
- This applied ML team is responsible for improving our member experience by innovating on algorithms for all aspects of Search and other discovery canvases where members express their entertainment needs explicitly. Such mechanisms are a primary way for our members to discover and engage with content on our service.

188,188,dc,neural networks,Train a DEEP Neural Network (e.g. transformer) to back-engineer...,Learning specialist,Upwork, Anywhere ,,"I have a dataset of Images that were created from DOCX documents. My goal is to train a deep neural network to back-engineer the original DOCX documents just from these images. The back-engineered DOCX document should look as close as possible as the originals, including tables, images, font colors, types, column layout and so on...

Next to the images I also have two different HTML... representations of the content of each image already created with two OCR systems which might also be helpful during the process.

The Task is the following

1. Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case.

2. Evaluate if it is possible to start from some pre-trained network or if it is necessary to start from the scratch

3. Choose a good framework for training the network

4. It should easily be possible to resume the training process whenever new training data comes in

What I head in mind was some kind of combination of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and/or Transformer Networks. So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here.

The goal is really to train a network that learns to create vaild DOCX documents and back-engineer the target documents from the training data that way. In principle a docx document is a zipped collection of XML files and binary data so it should be possible to create such output with a neural network. (You can try by renaming the a docx to .zip and then unzip it)

In the attachment you find a sample training data for one document. I can provide you with 1.5k of these documents right away to get started and can create a HUGE amount for improving the output quality later.

I can also set up an environment with a GPU and common access if needed. For getting started right away, it would be ideal if you already have some GPU at hand ","So one of the main challenges of the task would be to come up with an architecture that makes sense here I can also set up an environment with a GPU and common access if needed For getting started right away, it would be ideal if you already have some GPU at hand :-)",Evaluate the different types of deep neural networks on the market and figure out which is the best for this use case It should easily be possible to resume the training process whenever new training data comes in,,Contractor,,,

Job Description:

(Please Note: This is a 100% remote position that requires residence in the United States.)

We're looking for machine learning engineers with a background in reinforcement learning. Candidates with expertise in any of the following areas are highly desirable:
• Closing the sim2real gap
• Sparse rewards and credit assignment over long time horizons
• Offline learning
• Options learning and other hierarchical approaches
• Unsupervised exploration techniques
• Gym development (especially around complex DoD wargaming and platform simulation systems!)

As a company co-founded and led by engineers, we are focused on developer experience. We promise to minimize distractions (read: meetings) and to provide tools which maximize productivity. We are also committed to providing competitive total compensation, including profit sharing.

What You'll Do:

We are a small company, so you can expect to be an integral part of all phases of product development. Including lots and lots of flight testing. Here are a few examples of how you’ll contribute to the development of our tactical AI assistant, Scipio:
• Develop policies for tasks ranging from low-level aircraft control to high-level task assignment.
• Transition policies to a number of physical unmanned vehicles and evaluate performance in the field.
• Incorporate new aircraft/sensor models and simulation environments into our multi-fidelity hierarchical M&S framework.

About You:

There are no educational requirements. We're more interested in projects you've worked on - both on the job and on the side. So please be prepared to discuss those! The ideal candidate will have excellent Python skills and be adept in at least one ML framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).

Application Process:

We have a two-stage interview process.

The
first stage is a screener which is a combination of technical
discussion about relevant engineering concepts as well as your past
experience. This screener is generally around 30 minutes.

After
the screener, if both sides believe it makes sense, we will provide
you with an 'offline' coding test. This test is done on your own time,
at your own pace, so you do not feel the pressure of coding live with
us watching. We want you to do your best with a clear mind and free of
interview jitters. The questions are a combination of algorithm and
system design. Once you complete the test, we'll all hop back on another
call and you will walk us through your code. We are not just looking
for the right answers, we're interested in your thought processes and
technical approach.

[15], has emerged as a rich and flexible generalization of the Bayesian probability theory, able to deal with imperfect (uncertain, imprecise, …) information. It is notably used in a growing number of applications such as classification (e.g. [2]), clustering (e.g. [3,7]) or information fusion (e.g. [5,13]).

Recent works [6,16,17] have shown the interest of enriching a DNN with an additional distance-based
Dempster Shafer layer [2] for predicting belief functions. These belief functions can be of great interest to represent a reality as faithfully as possible, for example to perform a partial classification [8], i.e. decisions in favor of a group of classes.

The main idea of this thesis is to develop such deep evidential networks in more depth by exploiting methods developed at LGI2A allowing one to consider finer knowledge about the quality [12, 14] and the dependence of information [11], or the ignorance in predictions [9,10].

Two applications are envisaged: Image analysis from drones and fish population analysis.

•Enjoy thinking through trade-offs with mindfulness of near-term needs and Curai’s long-term strategy.

•Are collaborative and appreciate working with people with diverse expertise.

What You’ll Do

•Design, build, deploy, and improve machine learning models, including those that are based on large language models. These models are used in our patient and physician-facing product features and developed in collaboration with our clinical innovation, research, engineering, and design teams.

•Design offline and online evaluations to test ML product features, and perform data-driven analysis of the results to find actionable insights.

Enable rapid and rigorous scientific innovation by a multidisciplinary team of Curai clinicians, engineers, and researchers, through platform, tools, and documentation.

•Participate in interviewing diverse talent to build and grow a strong ML engineering team.

What You’ll Need

•“End-to-end” experience building ML production systems: Along with strong ML fundamentals, you will need exposure to the entire lifecycle of machine learning production systems, such as data processing, modeling, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and improving the models over time using feedback loops.

•Experience in natural language processing applications

•""Product sense"" or intuition on what to build: With guidance, you will need to be able to translate product intuition into data-driven hypotheses that result in impactful machine learning/engineering solutions.

•Strong communication skills: This role involves collaboration with product, engineering, clinical, and research teams. Understanding the mental models of the audience and communicating ideas crisply to this diverse set of stakeholders will be a vital part of the role. You should be comfortable leading cross-functional machine learning product initiatives, from conception to successful product outcomes.

•2+ years of industry experience in ML/NLP including building production systems.
