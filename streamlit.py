From the inital analysis of comparing DC against the remaining cities of the United States, we found that DC may be a good place for Georgeotwn DSAN graduates to stay after graduation for its high salary in domains of general Data Science or Data Analytics. From this, we have conlcuded our initial assumption that DC, is in fact a Data Science welcoming environment with abundant opportunities. However, as mentioned before, the store that data tells us is what we make of it. From the experience, we do know that DC is generally a hub for government realted occupations. With that being said, the roles that are often available in DC are government related, hindering international students to participate in the progress of applying. Thus, we can conclude that depending on who the user of this platform is, it is very important to understand this context before anything else.")
    st.write("Next, as we looked at two different scenarios of choosing the location of DSAN students' post graduation job locations, we saw that 'perception' changes everything. Staerting from the importance of location, we found California to be one of the price locations as the state has abundance of opportunities for advanced Data Science materials. However, when lookikng at the data from the persepctive of focus in domain knowledge, it was evident that NY or even VA were among the top choices where Data Scientists would be copmensated fairly. In that sense, we can gather from the understandings that it is what the user focuses on, no ground truth in data as well.")
    st.write("And as a final closing remark, I wanted to say thank you, as this mini-project actually has been a lot of fun. Having to use Streamlit for the first time in a long time to this extent, brought reminded me of how, when showing work, it is not just the content that matters, but also the presentations. Hope whoever views this enjoys the content, and finds it useful. Hopefully in the future, with more data, we will be able to dive deeper into the realms of each cities, and garner more data analysis out of it.")
